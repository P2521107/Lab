<div class="Synopsis">
<p>Mean Girls is the 2004 teen movie classic about a girl called Cady who moves to the US to start public school at North Shore High School after living in Africa with her parents for 12 years. Having been home schooled her whole life, the transition to adjusting to high school life and making new friends met Cady with some difficulties. She makes friends with Janis and Damian who are considered as outsiders on the hierarchy of cliques, to which they encourage Cady to avoid the Plastics – the mean girls, led by Regina George who is seen as the most popular girl in school. Cady finds herself making friends with the Plastics and endures being bossed around and told what to do and how to act by Regina. Eventually things get worse when Cady meets the heartthrob of the school Aaron, in her maths class one day. She falls in love and to her surprise later on discovers that Aaron is Regina’s ex. This meets Cady with some complications, but this iconic teen film is also a relatable comedy about school life.

  Being a first-person story, the movie is relatable in some way to us all; those of us who have been to High School. It shows a reflection of the pressures all young people and teens face through High School, especially in terms of achieving popularity status. The movie is an iconic piece of pop culture especially for millennials, the catchphrases are unforgettably hilarious and timeless. After 15 years most of the lines in the movie have never died, teenagers even now pay homage by wearing pink on Wednesday’s and using some of the catchphrases such as “You can’t sit with us!” and “That is so fetch!”. The endless memes and gifs keep the movie alive and October 3rd is the official Mean Girls Day; teenagers across the world bond over sharing the hashtag #October3rd and #MeanGirlsDay. In 2018, popstar Ariana Grande released a music video called ‘Thank u, next’ which is an entire homage to Mean Girls. Within the music video she has actors from Mean Girls say the famous catchphrases they said in the movie, alongside the re-make of the most famous scenes and the use of props such as the most iconic Burn Book.</p>
